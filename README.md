# clox #
   
My first foray into PLD, and understanding how actual interpreters and compilers work,
following [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/ "Crafting Interpreters"),
an excellent book by Bob Nystrom.

This implementation of `clox` follows faithfully the canonical bytecode compiler
implementation in C as detailed in the book.

_NOTE: This repository is in early stages of work in progress!_
